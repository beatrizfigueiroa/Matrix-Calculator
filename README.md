# Matrix-Calculator

This project was proposed by my programming professor Diego Pinheiro

Activity proposed: Make all Junit tests pass

1. Implement a method to calculate copound interest.
(For this it must be given the initial amount, the number of periods to calculate the final amount and a vector of interest rates to be analyzed)


2. Implement methods ables to return:

    *matrix multiplication

    *matrix transpose 

    *submatrix

    *matrix determinant 

    *matrix cofactor

    *matrix adjugated

    *matrix inverse 

3. Implement a method to check wether the matrix is singular or not.
